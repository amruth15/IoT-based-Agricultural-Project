# IoT-based-Agricultural-Project
Smart Agriculture reduces wastage of water, fertilizers and increases the crop yield. Here a system is proposed to monitor crop-field using sensors for soil moisture, humidity and temperature. By monitoring these parameters, the irrigation system can be automated if soil moisture is low.
The system is a combination of hardware and software components. The Internet of things (IOT) is revamping the agribusiness engaging the farmers by the broad assortment of techniques, for instance, accuracy and conservative cultivation to go up against challenges in the field. IOT advancement aids in social affair information on conditions like atmosphere, temperature and productivity of soil, harvest web watching engages area of yeild, level of water, bug acknowledgment, alter improvement, cultivation. The concentration of this system is mainly on the yield, where this system helps in getting more and high yield by the study of soilâ€™s Moisture, Humidity, Temperature rate and other parameters. An Intelligent IOT Based Automated Agriculture has been proposed so as to reduce the wastage of water and mainly monitors the behavior of soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature and evaluate the needs of water in a plant. Farmers would be able to smear to right amount of water at the right time by automatic irrigation.
